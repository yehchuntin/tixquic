# **App Name**: TicketSwift

## Core Features:

- Module Access Control: Module purchasing and access via locally-validated access keys
- Loyalty Points: Accumulate credit
- Solve Captchas: Use the OpenAI API to read CAPTCHAs for the ticket platform. Provide a field for the user to enter their OpenAI API key.
- Admin Interface: Administrative interface for adding, removing, and managing ticket events.

- Authentication: Handle Google Login on the web. For the app, use access key for module access.
- AI-Powered Seat Prediction: Analyzes seating chart data and historical success rates to predict optimal seating locations. This LLM uses a tool to determine how many people have purchased a module, and whether the desired location will result in a low probability of success.
- Success Rate Comparison: Generates a detailed report comparing the ticket-snatching success rates between users of our bot and those attempting to purchase tickets manually. Presents data visually to highlight the bot's efficiency.
